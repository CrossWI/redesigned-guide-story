Rick Jones looked at the giant pint glass in his hands and felt horrible. He 
walked over to the window and reflected on his grand surroundings. He had
always loved magical Shanghai with its colorful and lucious enviroment. It was 
a place that encouraged his tendency to feel explore. Then he saw something 
in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Molly Nolan. Molly was
a modest saint with blonde hair and curvy arms.

Rick Jones was immidiately scrambled out of his room and down the stair. He 
Rushed outlisde, trying to catch up with Molly Nolan beore she left. He ran all the
way to where he saw her but alas, she was gone before he got to her.
