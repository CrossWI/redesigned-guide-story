Rick Jones looked at the giant pint glass in his hands and felt horrible. He 
walked over to the window and reflected on his grand surroundings. He had
always loved magical Shanghai with its colorful and lucious enviroment. It was 
a place that encouraged his tendency to feel explore. Then he saw something 
in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Molly Nolan. Molly was
a modest saint with blonde hair and curvy arms.

Rick Jones was immidiately scrambled out of his room and down the stair. He 
Rushed outlisde, trying to catch up with Molly Nolan beore she left. He ran all
the way to where he saw her but alas, she was gone before he got to her. 

Rick looked to the ground, defeated. Demoralized, Rick turned around and began
to walk to his room. But as he turned around, he saw the shoes. The shoes that
Molly was wearing when he saw her image. He slowly looked up at met her eyes.

Molly walked back into the house, approaching Rick. Rick was shocked that she 
would return after what he had done a month prior. He tried to embrace her but 
she refused his offer, instead taking a step back outside. 

"Rick, I'm not here to make ammends, I'm only here for the ring that I left on
your nightstand."

"I see, I stil apologize for how I acted after coming home from the bars."

"I don't want to hear it Rick, I'll be gone soon," Molly said, pushing him out 
of the way and marching up the stairs.

Rick walked to the living room, defeated once again. He had let the love of his 
life walk away once, and now she is leaving again. With that, Molly was gone.

Rick couldn't bear to the let the love of his life walk away once more, so he quickly 
chased after her and pleaded her to stay. He offered molly the one thing she had always
wanted, a baby. He told her he was finally willing to throw his old life away and settle
down with her, and have a family. Molly was finally able to forgive him and they lived,
happily ever after.
